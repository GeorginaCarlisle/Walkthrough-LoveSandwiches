## Description of the Love Sandwiches application

Love Sandwiches has been built for a fictional sandwich shop and links via an API to a google sheet which records:
- sandwich sales
- surplus stock at the end of each day
- number of sandwiches to be made for the next day

The user can enter the new sandwich sales data at the end of each day and the app will calculate the surplus stock and then the number of sandwiches to be made the following day.

The data input by the user is validated to check that it matches requirements
